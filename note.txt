In order to be able to use docker with the testing python script, I had to change the url to:
url = 'http://host.docker.internal:4723/wd/hub'
The line below (line 17) has the correct url (if you're running the script without docker).

I've used appium-desktop-setup-1.10.0 for this assignment.

A video that shows the whole testing process was attached with the submittion message (in case it was needed).

SETUP:
- run the appium server
- if using bot dockerfile, change the env section to the bots token
- run the bot script
- open android studio and run the android emulator
- go to the bot testing script, and change the `deviceName` in the capabilities dictionary if needed (to the name of your device)
- run the bot testing script
